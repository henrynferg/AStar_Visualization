# AStar_Visualization
A visualization of the A* algorithm in Tkinter.

ASTAR

This is a pathfinding visualization with a brute-force breadth-first search algorithm and a greedy A* algorithm with a Euclidean distance 
heuristic. Each algorithm finds a path between the start square and the end square, travelling left, right, up, down, and diagonally.

This program is currently run through the AStar.py file.

A GUI with three buttons and a canvas filled with blue squares should come up. Follow the instruction label on the GUI to run the program.

There are many different square colors the program uses. Here are what they mean:

Blue = normal square
Yellow = starting square
Orange = goal square
Green = path the algorithm found
Red = squares the algorithm checked that were not part of the path.
